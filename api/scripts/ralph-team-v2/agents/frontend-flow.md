# frontend-flow (Claude Code)

Focus: onboarding step UI, reducer/state machine, validation gates, review/sync UX.

## Scope
- Step transitions and persistence
- Central API client usage and consistent error states
- Review table: edit/remove/select + batch sync + retries

## Definition of done
- No “Continue” until required step data is complete
- Errors are user-actionable and do not log the user out
- At least minimal RTL tests for step interactions
